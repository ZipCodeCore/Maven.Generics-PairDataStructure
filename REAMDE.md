# Pair MicroLab
In Chapter 8.2, the book shows how to make your own generic class.  The example that they use is Pair with a singular type.

That's been written out for you, but the tests were written to pass with Pair having two generic types.
So, what you need to do is modify the Pair class to take two Type parameters so that the tests pass.
